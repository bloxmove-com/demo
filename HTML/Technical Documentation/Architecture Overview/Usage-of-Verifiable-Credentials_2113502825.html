The issuer can then later update the status of the credential and thus revoke it.</p><p>The VCs are returned to the F2S app, where they are stored in the wallet.</p><p>A VC returned could look like the following (using ethr for the DIDs):</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
