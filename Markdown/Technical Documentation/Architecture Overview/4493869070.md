BloXmove generally uses a 1-step process when requesting an action, e.g.
when requesting a rental.

<div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
export class RentalRequest implements IRentalRequest {

  constructor(vehicleDID: string,
              consumerDID: string,
              packageId: number,
              timestamp?: number,
              consumerSignature?: string,
              verifiablePresentation?: IVerifiablePresentation | string) {
    this.vehicleDID = vehicleDID;
    this.consumerDID = consumerDID;
    this.packageId = packageId;
    this.timestamp = timestamp;
    this.consumerSignature = consumerSignature;
    this.verifiablePresentation = verifiablePresentation;
  }
}
```

</div>

</div>

This allow the request to be processed immediately as the requesting
participant is required to provide sufficient information for the
service participant to verify her authorization.

## Alternative Flows for a Claims / Credential Exchange

### Decentralized Identity Foundation

The DIF lists several approaches for requesting and presenting
credentials:
<https://github.com/decentralized-identity/papers/blob/master/Credential%20Exchange%20Message%20Formats%20Survey.md>

The presentation exchange is described here:
<https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/> with a library in
typescript: <https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/pe-js> A further
sample is by the DIF
<https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange/tree/master/sample-implementation>

The DIF further proposes a mechanism to describe the requested
information from a validating participant to a wallet:
<https://identity.foundation/credential-manifest/> Their description of
the exchange protocol has not advanced beyond draft status: WACI PeX
(Wallet And Credential Interactions Presentation Exchange)
<https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html#:~:text=open%20source%20implementations.-,AreWeWaciYet%3F,-Repo>.

### Hyperledger Aries

Aries has developed a series of standards (current:
<https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/eace815c3e8598d4a8dd7881d8c731fdb2bcc0aa/features/0037-present-proof/README.md>
proposed:
<https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/eace815c3e8598d4a8dd7881d8c731fdb2bcc0aa/features/0454-present-proof-v2/README.md>
superseded:
<https://hackmd.io/@QNKW9ANJRy6t81D7IfgiZQ/HkklVzww4?type=view> that
describe a flow where both parties can initiate the credential exchange.
However, even if the requesting participant is initiating the exchange,
the exact scope of information requested is defined by the validating
participant:

### W3C

The <https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/> (draft) defines
capabilities that enable third-party Web applications to handle
credential requests and storage (ie. how to build Wallets for Websites).

### uPort

uPort defines the Selective disclosure flow
<https://github.com/uport-project/specs/blob/develop/flows/selectivedisclosure.md>
for an app requesting credentials from the uPort wallet.

### Jolocom

<https://jolocom-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactionFlows.html> is
also defining a validator-initiated request flow for credentials:

<div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;">

<div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
// An instance of an identityWallet is required at this point
const credentialRequest = await identityWallet.create.interactionTokens.request.share({
  callbackURL: 'https://example.com/authentication/',
  credentialRequirements: [{
    type: ['Credential', 'ProofOfEmailCredential'],
    constraints: []
  }],
}, password)
```
