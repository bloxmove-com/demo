Should it be used in the bloxmove system ?

  - To derive certain fields of a VC, VCs must be signed with the
    signature type: `BbsBlsSignature2020`

  - Accordingly to the Spherity API, this type is not supported as of
    now to issues this kind of VCs

  - Also i could not find a way to issue VCs based on this signature
    type with the plain ethereum stack which is used currently in the
    bloxmove system

  - If there would be a way to use ethereum keys to issue this type of
    signature, the asset lib needs a whole refactoring and we need a
    library then (e.g.
    →<https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs> )

  - Also documentation of this signatures are often still in draft mode
    (e.g.
    <https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/#the-bbs-signature-proof-suite-2020>
    )

  - And this one was published in August this year →
    <https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/>

Conclusion:

I am not sure what the current benefits are, if we use this type of
signatures in this early state.

There could be more problems than benefits.
